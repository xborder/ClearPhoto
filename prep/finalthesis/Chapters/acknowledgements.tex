The contributions of several people and entities have made this thesis possible and I would like to extend my appreciation especially to the following.

First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor Prof. Nuno Correia for the opportunity of letting me work and explore this project, and for his guidance and support.

Furthermore, I would like to thank the Departamento de Informática da Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa (DI - FCT/UNL) for being my second home during these five years and financially support me during the second semester and giving me the opportunity to gain experience as a teaching assistant.

Special thanks to my family, who have supported me through this hard path, in particular my parents and girlfriend, for their immense patience, encouragement and endless love.

To my colleagues, with who I shared the same space, adversities and laughs, day in and day out through these years, and who I am thankful for taking some time off to be my test subjects and answer my survey for evaluating this thesis.
